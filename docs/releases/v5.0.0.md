## Breaking Changes üíî

Starting with the v5.0.0 of the Logging Core Module Loki version has been bumped to 3.4.2. Please refer to [`loki documentation`](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/v3.4.x/setup/upgrade/)
for the complete release notes.

## Update Guide ü¶Æ

### Before upgrading Loki from 2.9.10 to 3.4.2

When upgrading Loki the Ingester StatefulSet needs to be scaled to at least 2 replicas before executing the upgrade to avoid losing logs that have not been flushed to a remote storage yet. Notice that the Ingester has an HPA defined and could already be scaled.

Once the StatefulSet has been scaled a patch needs to be applied to add the `-ingester.flush-on-shutdown=true` and the `-log.level=debug` flags on the Ingester. This will allow the Ingester to flush logs that still need to be pushed to the long term storage.

You can achieve this by using the following shell script:

```bash

ingester_replicas=$(kubectl get statefulsets.apps -n logging loki-distributed-ingester -o jsonpath={.status.currentReplicas})

if [ "${ingester_replicas}" -lt "2" ]; then
  kubectl scale sts -n logging loki-distributed-ingester --replicas=2
  kubectl wait -n logging statefulset/loki-distributed-ingester --for=jsonpath='{.status.availableReplicas}'=2 --timeout=5m
fi

kubectl patch statefulset loki-distributed-ingester -n logging --type='json' -p="[{\"op\":\"replace\",\"path\":\"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args\",\"value\":[\"-config.file=/etc/loki/config/config.yaml\",\"-ingester.flush-on-shutdown=true\",\"-log.level=debug\",\"-target=ingester\"]}]"

kubectl rollout status -n logging statefulset/loki-distributed-ingester

```

Once the StatefulSet is stable and the patch has been applied the upgrade can be executed.

### Upgrade using the distribution

To upgrade the module using the distribution please refer to the [`official documentation`](https://docs.kubernetesfury.com/docs/upgrades/upgrades)

### Manual Upgrade

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** Manually upgrading the module is deprecated. It is recommended to use it with the [`SIGHUP Distribution`](https://github.com/sighupio/distribution).

To upgrade the module run:

```bash
kustomize build | kubectl apply -f - --server-side
```
