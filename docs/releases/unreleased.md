## New Features üéâ

### Kubernetes 1.33 Support

This release adds support for Kubernetes 1.33.x, expanding the compatibility matrix to support Kubernetes versions 1.22 through 1.33.

### Logging Operator and Logging Operated

Updated logging-operator from v5.2.0 to v6.0.3 with enhanced Kubernetes 1.33 compatibility and improved performance. The stack now includes:

- Updated Fluent Bit to v4.0.3 for better log collection
- Updated Fluentd to v6.0.3-full for enhanced log processing
- Added support for Axosyslog custom resource definition for advanced logging configurations
- Increased fluentd's default resource requests (1 CPU, 700 Mi Memory) and limits (2 CPU, 1.5 Gi Memory) based on production usage statistics
- Increased fluentbit's default requests (CPU: 100m, Memory: 100M) for better resource allocation
- Enhanced flush performance with increased flush thread counts on all output plugins

### Loki Components

Loki Distributed maintains compatibility at v3.4.2 with configuration improvements:
- Increased flush thread counts on all output plugins to improve network flush performance

### MinIO HA

Fixed a critical bug [[#189](https://github.com/sighupio/module-logging/pull/189)] where the `mc` utility image was missing the tag and defaulting to latest. This could have caused issues when upstream releases breaking changes.

## Breaking Changes üíî

- **NodeAgent CRD Removal**: The NodeAgent CRD has been deprecated and removed in logging-operator v6.0.x. All NodeAgent functionality has been replaced by HostTailer resources which provide enhanced capabilities for system log collection.
